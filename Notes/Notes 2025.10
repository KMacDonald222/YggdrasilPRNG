2025.10.15:

@10:01ADT: Setting up the basics of the building/testing workflow for this
project. There will eventually be two driver programs, but only one will be used
for now for testing during development of the YggdrasilPRNG library. This will
test the process of building the library into an archive (for Linux only, but
eventually other platforms), including and linking it in the YGen generator
driver program, and running some of its code.

@11:06ADT: The build/test workflow is now up and running as described above.
